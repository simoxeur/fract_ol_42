## ðŸ“œ Project Description

Fract-ol is a graphical project that generates beautiful fractals using the MiniLibX graphical library in C.

The projectâ€™s main goal is to explore complex numbers, iterations, and graphics programming by rendering different types of mathematical fractals in real-time.  

It offers a great introduction to:

    - Working with complex mathematical formulas
    
    - Handling low-level graphics (pixel-by-pixel drawing)

    - Event handling (keyboard, mouse interactions)

    - Optimizing rendering loops

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Render multiple famous fractals, including:

        Mandelbrot set

        Julia set

        (Optional) Other fractals like the Burning Ship

- Allow user interaction:

        Zoom in / out

        Move across the fractal

        Change colors

- Handle mouse and keyboard events smoothly.

- Ensure high performance and accuracy in rendering.


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo copied>
   cd fract_ol_42

2. Clone MLX library if you haven't already.

         git clone https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.git mlx
  
3. Compile the project:
      
        make

5. Run the game:
    Mandelbrot set:  
            ./fractol mandelbrot
    julia set:  
            ./fractol julia <imaginair> <real>
    burning_ship set:
            ./fractol burning_ship
